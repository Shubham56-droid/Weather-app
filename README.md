<h2>Installtion of icons</h2>
<p>In order to add icons go to https://github.com/erikflowers/weather-icons in browser.</p>
<h4>Basic Usage</h4>
<p>
Place the 5 font files and the main weather-icons.min.css file in your project, with the assumption that the fonts are located up ../ from your CSS directory.
<br/>
The icons are displayed by using an i element and adding the base class wi and then the icon class you want, such as day-sunny. This then looks like <i class="wi wi-day-sunny"></i>.
<br/>
To add a modifier, include the class you want after the icon name, which looks like <i class="wi wi-day-sunny wi-flip-vertical"></i>. You can flip, rotate, or add a fixed width.
